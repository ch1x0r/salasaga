Specifically on X, when a person opens the drop down menu for most applications that application does a "grab"
off all keyboard input thus stopping the screenshot key from working.

The way around this, for at least the version of X I'm running (X.Org 7.1.1), is to add:

	Option         "AllowDeactivateGrabs" "true"

... to the "ServerFlags" section of your xorg.conf file, and restart X.

Next time you want to do a screenshot and something is blocking the screenshot key, press Control-Alt-/
first to tell X to "ungrab", then press the Screenshot combo (generally Control-Printscreen) and that will
work.  You'll need to press Control-Alt-/ every time you want to ungrab though, not just the first time
it happens.

For me, this works. :)

Windows (MinGW) notes: After installing all of the GTK, Glib, (etc) stuff, pkg-config didn't work until I'd set the environment variable:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/c/MinGW/lib/pkgconfig

$ pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags
  -mms-bitfields -Ic:/MinGW/include/gtk-2.0 -Ic:/MinGW/lib/gtk-2.0/include -Ic:/MinGW/include/atk-1.0 -Ic:/MinGW/include/cairo -Ic:/MinGW/include/pango-1.0 -Ic:/devel/dist/cairo-1.0.4/include/cairo -Ic:/MinGW/include/glib-2.0 -Ic:/MinGW/lib/glib-2.0/include

 It's difficult to locate some of the Gnome stuff, pre-compiled for Win32.
 ftp.gnome.org has them, under (i.e.) /platform/2.12/2.12.2/win32/

 This is a local mirror (to me) of that location.
 http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/gnome/platform/2.12/2.12.2/win32/
