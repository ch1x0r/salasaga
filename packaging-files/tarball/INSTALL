Salasaga compilation and installation
*************************************

Compilation and installation should be very easy. :)

After extracting the files from the archive, you
just need to...

1. Run autoconf:

    $ autoconf


2. Follow the standard compilation steps:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install


Once the "make install" has finished, Salasaga should
have been properly installed and be available from
the Gnome menu (under Graphics).

Alternatively, you can launch Salasaga from the command line:

    $ salasaga


No errors should occur during compiling nor installation.
If they do occur, please let us know (it's important!).

All feedback, thoughts, and suggestions are welcome, as well as
any goodwill and contributions you'd like to make. :)
