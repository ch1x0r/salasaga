This is the Ubuntu prepackaged version of Justin Clift's Flame
Project application.

This application is an Integrated Development Environment for producing
Animated SVG files.

This package was first put together by Justin Clift and is currently
maintained by him. The source for this release was taken from:

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/flameproject/flameproject-0.7.7.dev-200707101927.tar.bz2

The changes were very minimal:

- Adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.
