Salasaga compilation and installation
*************************************

Compilation and installation should be very easy. :)

After extracting the files from the archive, you
just need to..

1. Run autogen.sh:

    $ ./autogen.sh


2. Follow the standard compilation steps:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install


Once the "make install" has finished, the screen capture
utility for Salasaga should have been properly installed.

You will still need to install the main Salasaga IDE, normally
found in the "salasaga_ide" directory above this
"salasaga_screencapture" on.

No errors should occur during compiling nor installation.
If they do occur, please let us know (it's important!).
